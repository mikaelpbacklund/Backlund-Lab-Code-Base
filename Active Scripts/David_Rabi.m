%Runs a simple Rabi sequence with no Ï„ compensation or stage optimization

%Highly recommended to use a "time per data point" of at least 3 seconds
%Lower than this is sensitive to jitters in number of points collected,
%resulting in failed and/or erroneous points

%Required
p.scanBounds = [10 1010]; %RF duration bounds
p.scanStepSize = 50; %Step size for RF duration
p.collectionType = 'counter';%analog or counter

%General
p.RFamplitude = 10;
p.sequenceTimePerDataPoint = 3;%Before factoring in forced delay and other pauses
p.nIterations = 1; %Number of iterations of scan to perform
p.timeoutDuration = 10; %How long before auto-continue occurs
p.forcedDelayTime = .125; %Time to force pause before (1/2) and after (full) collecting data
p.nDataPointDeviationTolerance = .2;%How precies measurement is. Lower number means more exacting values, could lead to repeated failures
p.baselineSubtraction = 0;%Amount to subtract from both reference and signal collected
p.collectionDuration = 0;%How long to collect data for. 0 means overwritten by DAQ rate
p.collectionBufferDuration = 1000;%How long to wait between end of RF pulse and beginning of data collection
p.AOMCompensation = 0;%How long AOM should be on before DAQ (negative flips to DAQ first)
p.RFReduction = 0;%Time to add to each RF pulse due to RF generator reducing pulse duration

%Config file names
p.pulseBlasterConfig = 'pulse_blaster_default';
p.SRSRFConfig = 'SRS_RF';

p.plotAverageContrast = true;

%Stage optimization
p.optimizationEnabled = true; %Set to false to disable stage optimization
p.optimizationAxes = {'z'}; %The axes which will be optimized over
p.optimizationSteps = {-2:0.1:2}; %Locations the stage will move relative to current location
p.optimizationRFStatus = 'off'; %'off', 'on', or 'con' 
p.timePerOpimizationPoint = .1; %Duration of each data point during optimization
p.timeBetweenOptimizations = 300; %Seconds between optimizations (Inf to disable, 0 for optimization after every point)
p.useOptimizationTimer = true;
p.percentageForcedOptimization = .75; %see below (0 to disable)
p.useOptimizationPercentage = false;

%percentageForcedOptimization is a more complex way of deciding when to do an optimization.
%After every optimization, the reference value of the next data point is recorded. After every data point, if the
%reference value is lower than X percent of that post-optimization value, a new optimization will be performed. This
%means setting the value to 1 corresponds to running an optimization if the value obtained is lower at all than the
%post-optimization value, .75 means running optimization if less than 3/4 post-optimization value etc.
